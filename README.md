# PyCodec
Learning Codecs in Python

**Objective**
------------

Develop a Python-based codec library that can compress and decompress various types of data, including text, images, and audio.

**Project Scope**
----------------

### Data Types
#### Text
* ASCII
* UTF-8

#### Images
* JPEG
* PNG
* GIF

#### Audio
* WAV
* MP3

### Codecs
#### Huffman
#### LZW
#### LZ77

### API
* Simple and intuitive API for users to compress and decompress data
* Optimize the codec for performance and efficiency

**Project Timeline**
-------------------

### Week 1-2: Research and Planning
* Research existing codecs and their implementations
* Plan the project scope, timeline, and milestones
* Define the project requirements and goals

### Week 3-6: Implement the Codec Library
* Implement the Huffman codec
* Implement the LZW codec
* Implement the LZ77 codec
* Implement support for multiple data types

### Week 7-8: Test and Debug the Codec Library
* Test the codec library with various data types and inputs
* Debug any issues or errors that arise
* Optimize the codec for performance and efficiency

### Week 9-10: Document and Release the Codec Library
* Write documentation for the codec library, including API documentation and usage examples
* Release the codec library as an open-source project

**Project Deliverables**
-------------------------

* A Python-based codec library that can compress and decompress various types of data
* A comprehensive documentation for the codec library, including API documentation and usage examples
* A release of the codec library as an open-source project
